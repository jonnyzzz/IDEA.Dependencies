How to use
==========
Fork this repo and merge it into your repo
Complete ```fetch.xml``` with actual dependencies

The sctips also updates IDEA library files to include new-ly added librariries to IDEA project.
It's expected you'll no changed files on script re-run. If you do => post the issue with diff 

We use  [Maven Ant Tasks](http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/examples/dependencies.html)
inside. So `<dependency>` element under `<maven-fetch>` is the same
element as under Maven Ant Tasks
